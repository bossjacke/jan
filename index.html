    <h2 style="font-size: 50px;">This concrete is too cold, to be walking on it <br>
      Or else walking on it with no shoes on (no shoes on)<br>
      Don't wanna struggle, oh no<br>
      Don't want it to become a habit<br>
      I've been living in the gutter with no shoes on<br>
      Let me get up out of here<br>
      Before I hurt somebody<br>
      Or I have to hurt somebody<br>
      Before I hurt somebody<br>
      Or I have to hurt somebody<br>
      Before I hurt somebody<br>
      Or I have to hurt somebody<br>
      My momma need a crib<br>
      Son needs some Jordan's<br>
      This some bull shit, cause I can't afford them<br>
      Pairs listening<br>
      And the band recording<br>
      Trying to dodge the pen<br>
      Hoping I survive the morning<br>
      Shit is getting hot<br>
      Man I'm talking scourging<br>
      Watching bodies drop<br>
      Trying to make a fortune<br>
      Dancing with no top<br>
      Trying to skip my fork and<br>
      Wanna own the block<br>
      Then you gotta put your work in<br>
      Cause<br>
      This concrete is too cold, to be walking on it<br>

      Before I hurt somebody<br>
      Or I have to hurt somebody<br>
      Before I hurt somebody<br>
      Or I have to hurt somebody<br>
      instead of calling<br>
      Dreaming out the sale, tell me wake up in the morning<br>
      Magic warp, always disappears<br>
      Smoked and my eyes blurred<br>
      But my vision clear<br>
      Hot head, but this concrete cold<br>
      Titanium bitch I never follow<br>
      Never judge a nigga before you judge yourself<br>
      You ain't got to help me<br>
      Nigga help yourself<br>
      They got me up in here<br>
      I don't know what they're talking<br>
      Well tell them I'm the mob<br>
      I don't own them<br>
      I'll take the sugar sharks<br>
      They can't breathe out the water<br>
      I'll tear your ass apart and put you out of order<br>
      This concrete is too cold, to be walking on it<br>
      Or else walking on it with no shoes on (no shoes on)<br>

      <h2 style="font-size: 50px;"><hr style="height: 10px; background-color: aquamarine;">When I see you<br>
        I run out of words to say (oh, oh)<br>
        I wouldn't leave you<br>
        'Cause you're that type of girl to make me stay (oh, oh)<br>
        I see the guys tryna holla<br>
        Girl, I don't wanna bother you<br>
        'Cause you're independent and you got my attention<br>
        Can I be your baby father?<br>
        Girl, I just wanna show you<br>
        That I love what you are doin', huh<br>
        I see you in the club<br>
        You gettin' down good<br>
        I wanna get with you, yeah<br>
        I see you in the club<br>
        You showin' thugs love<br>
        I wanna get with you<br>
        You're so beautiful<br>
        So damn beautiful<br>
        Said you're so beautiful<br>
        So damn beautiful<br>
        You're so beautiful<br>
        Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful<br>
        You're so beautiful<br>
        Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful<br>
        You're so beautiful<br>
        Like the clouds, you<br>
        Drift me away, far away (yeah)<br>
        And like the sun, you<br>
        Brighten my day, you brighten my day (yeah)<br>
        I never wanna see you cry, cry, cry<br>
        And I never wanna tell a lie, lie, lie<br>
        Said I never wanna see you cry, cry, cry<br>
        And I never wanna tell a lie, lie, lie<br>
        I see you in the club<br>
        You gettin' down good<br>
        I wanna get with you, yeah<br>
        I see you in the club<br>
        You showin' thugs love<br>
        I wanna get with you<br>

        Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful<br>
        You're so beautiful<br>
        Kardinal told you<br>
        Whether the sky blue or yellow<br>
        This fella ain't that mellow<br>
        If it ain't about you (you)<br>
        Hourglass shape makes the place go (ooh)<br>
        Waistline makes my soldier salute<br>
        I'm a brute (brute)<br>
        High from your high-heeled game<br>
        High heels push up ya a last name<br>
        And you livin' in the fast lane, eyes like an angel (goddess)<br>
        Watch my yellin' as she undressed<br>
        Spotless, heartless, bad to the bone<br>
        Make me wanna go, put me in the triple-X zone (zone)<br>
        Lames don't know how to talk to you<br>
        So let me walk with you, hold my hand<br>
        I'ma spend them grands, but after you undress<br>
        Not like a hooker, but more like a princess<br>
        Queen, empress, president<br>
        Pull anywhere you go on earth, 'cause you're beautiful (okay?)<br>
        I see you in the club<br>
        You gettin' down good<br>
        I wanna get with you (ooh, yeah)<br>
        I see you in the club<br>
        You showin' thugs love<br>
        I wanna get with you<br>
        You're so beautiful<br>
        So damn beautiful<br>
        Said you're so beautiful (ooh, yeah)<br>
        So damn beautiful (so beautiful)<br>
        You're so beautiful<br>
        Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful<br>
        You're so beautiful<br>
        Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful<br>
        You're so beautiful<br>
        Where'd you come from?<br>
        You're outta this world to me (ah-ah)<br>
        You're a symbol of what every beautiful woman should be, ooh wee (ah-ah)<br>
        I never wanna see you cry, cry, cry (don't cry)<br>
        And I never wanna tell a lie, lie, lie (ooh yeah)<br>
        Said I never wanna see you cry, cry, cry (oh)<br>
        And I never wanna tell a lie, lie, lie (lie)<br>
